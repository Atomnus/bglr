	<p>Modern begleri has evolved immensely from its ancient beginnings, using sophisticated materials like metals or resin. Brass, aluminum, titanium, 
	and damascus steel are just a small example of the metals that are used, since traditional begleri made from semi-precious stones or materials 
	such as carved animal bone or horn tend to be somewhat delicate and do not stand up well to hard play. Bead sizes are generally from 15mm to 25mm 
	in diameter and weigh generally between 10g and 20g per bead.</p>
	<p>There are many ways to play with begleri, but the hobby is usually divided into two types of players: long game and short game. Long game begleri 
		uses a string length around 6 inches that allows all sorts of slow, aerial-style tricks. Short game begleri uses a string length of around 
		3 inches that allows for faster play that revolves around hand rotations and grip changes.</p>
	<p>There are numerous online begleri retailers that have made their debut among recent years of populatity in the hobby. Notable names are Aroundsquare, 
		a company that has expanded immensely in the past years creating innovative skill toy designs for enthusiasts, and TGP Begleri, who creates 
		colorful sets with magnetic or glow in the dark properties.</p>
